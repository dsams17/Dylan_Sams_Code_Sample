# Dylan_Sams_Code_Sample
This is my implementation of the Raft Consensus Algorithm (https://raft.github.io/) in Golang initially for CS451: Distributed Systems.

The features implemented in this version are:
* Leader election
* Log replication
* Snapshot and log compaction
* Persistent state for crash recovery

For notes on the general functioning of Raft please consult either the link provided above or Raft.md
